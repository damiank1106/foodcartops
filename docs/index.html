      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Megan Young Food Cart Co.</strong> (“we”, “us”) handles information
        when you use the <strong>Megan Young Food Cart Co.</strong> mobile application (“App”).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Summary:</strong> Megan Young Food Cart Co. is designed to store your operational data (sales, expenses, products,
        shifts, notes, and optional images like receipt photos) <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
        The App does not sell your data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Information the App Processes</h2>
    <p>The App may process the following types of information that you enter or choose to add:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account/Work data:</strong> usernames, PIN/password (used for local sign-in), roles, and settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Business records:</strong> sales totals, items, expenses, shift records, notes, and related operational details.</li>
      <li><strong>Images you choose:</strong> receipt photos, profile images, and/or product images you attach in the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Exports you initiate:</strong> CSV/PDF files generated by the App when you choose to export or share data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Collect Automatically</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information automatically through the App (no advertising identifiers,
      no third-party analytics SDKs for tracking). Any data you create is intended to remain on your device unless you export/share it.
    </p>

    <h2>Device Permissions Used</h2>
    <p>The App may request access to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera</strong> — to let you take photos (for example, receipt images) that you choose to attach.</li>
      <li><strong>Photos/Media (Storage)</strong> — to let you pick images from your library and to save/share exported files you generate.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet</strong> — required by the operating system for some features (e.g., opening links or system sharing flows). The App is not intended to upload your stored records to our servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Biometrics (optional)</strong> — if enabled on your device, the App may use Face ID/biometrics for local unlock where supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can control permissions in your device settings. If you deny a permission, some features (like attaching a receipt photo)
      may not work.
    </p>

    <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>
      FoodCartOps stores App data locally on your device (for example in a local database). Images you attach may be stored as local files
      referenced by the App. Export files (CSV/PDF) are generated on your device when you request them.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. The App only shares data when <strong>you</strong> choose to do so, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you email, print, or share an exported CSV/PDF using your device’s share options.</li>
      <li>When you choose to attach images from your library or take a photo, your device provider may handle that action (camera/photos).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you share an export via email or another service, the privacy practices of that service will apply to the shared file.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses system services and libraries provided by your mobile platform (Android/iOS) to support features like camera access,
      file handling, printing, email composition, and sharing. We do not operate a server that your records are uploaded to by default.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-device data:</strong> You can delete records inside the App (where features are provided) and/or remove the App to delete locally stored data from your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Exports:</strong> Exported files you create may remain in your device storage or the target app you shared them with, until you delete them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect data stored within the App (for example, using platform security features and secure local storage
      for sensitive values). No method of storage is 100% secure, but we aim to minimize risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      FoodCartOps is not directed to children under 13 and is intended for business/operational use. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date.
    </p>
